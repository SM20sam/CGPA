Hofstra's Formula for Calculating CGPA
"Multiply the number of semester hours of each grade earned by grade point value (this product equals the Quality Point for that grade). Then total the Quality Points 
and divide by the total number of semester hours for which a grade was earned. This quotient is the cumulative GPA"
